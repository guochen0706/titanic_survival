This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

# Overview of Data
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
data(diamonds)
dim(diamonds)
?diamonds

```


# Histogram of the price of all the diamonds
```{r}
qplot (x = price, data = diamonds)

```

# Summary of the price
```{r}
summary(diamonds$price)

```

# How many diamonds cost less than $500?
# How many diamonds cost less than $250?
# How many diamonds cost $15,000 or more?

```{r}
length(subset(diamonds$price, diamonds$price < 500))
length(subset(diamonds$price, diamonds$price < 250))
length(subset(diamonds$price, diamonds$price >= 15000))

```

# Explore the largest peak in the price histogram
```{r}
qplot(x = price, data = diamonds, binwidth = 1) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(600,1500,100), limits = c(600,1500))

```

# Break out histogram by cut
```{r}
qplot(x = price, data = diamonds) + 
  facet_wrap(~cut)
```

# Price By Cut
```{r}
by(diamonds$price, diamonds$cut, max)
by(diamonds$price, diamonds$cut, min)
by(diamonds$price, diamonds$cut, median)

```

# Histogarm of price per carat and facet it by cut
# Adjust the bin width and transform the scale of the x-axis using log10
```{r}
qplot(x = price/carat, data = diamonds, binwidth = 0.05) + 
  scale_x_log10() + 
  facet_wrap(~cut)

```

# Investigate the price of diamonds using box plots,
# numerical summaries, and one of the following categorical
# variables: cut, clarity, or color.

```{r}
qplot(x = clarity, y = price, data = diamonds, geom = "boxplot",
      xlab = "Clarity",
      ylab = "Price") +
  scale_y_continuous (limit = c(0,8000))

by(diamonds$price, diamonds$clarity, summary)
  
```

# What is the price range for the middle 50% of diamonds with color D?
# What is the price range for the middle 50% of diamonds with color J?
# What is the IQR for diamonds with the best color?
# What is the IQR for diamonds with the worst color?

```{r}
qplot(x = color, y = price, data = diamonds, geom = "boxplot",
      xlab = "Color",
      ylab = "Price") +
  scale_y_continuous (limit = c(0,8000))
by(diamonds$price, diamonds$color, summary)
IQR(subset(diamonds$price, diamonds$color == 'D'))
IQR(subset(diamonds$price, diamonds$color == 'J'))
```

# Investigate the price per carat of diamonds across
# the different colors of diamonds using boxplots.

```{r}
qplot(x = color, y = price/carat, data = diamonds, geom = "boxplot", 
      xlab = "Color",
      ylab = "Unit Price")

```


# Investigate the weight of the diamonds (carat) using a frequency polygon.
# Change bin width to see how freq count changes
# What carat size has a count greater than 2000?

```{r}
qplot (x = carat, data = diamonds, geom = "freqpoly", binwidth = 0.01) + 
  scale_x_continuous (breaks = seq(0,6,0.1))
```
